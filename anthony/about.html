        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I have liked videogames since I was little and that led me to get into the world of computing from a very young age.<br>
            Managing to learn many branches of the software and thanks to a game in which I worked for several years (ragnarok online) under the rAthena license, I was able to put my knowledge into practice in the real world.<br>   
            Study at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Nacional of Costa Rica a pilot plan of ISW-ILE (software engineering and English).<br>        
            Resulting today in a large amount of knowledge such as (database-web programmer-application programmer-2d/3d design-sounds-etc...)</p>
